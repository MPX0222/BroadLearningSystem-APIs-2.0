### API Models (Updated at 2023.09.06):

-- **BLS**: Based Broad Learning System, including ***BLSRegressor*** and ***BLSClassifier***. API ***fit*** and ***predict*** is available now. ***GridSearch*** will online soon.

-- **StackedBLS**: A Stacked Model of Broad Learning System, with several residual learning block, including ***StackedBLSClassifier***. API ***fit*** and ***predict*** is available now.. 

-- **ConvBLS**: An ensemble model based on a simple convoloution module and a Broad Learning System module, which enhance the ability of feature extraction for original BLS. API of this model would be upload sonn.
