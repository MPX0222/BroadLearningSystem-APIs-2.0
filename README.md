# BroadLearningSystemTools-2.0
***New Toolbox of Broad Learning System, with sklearn liked APIs. Created at 2023.08***

***A survey of current Broad learning Models:*** https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9380770/

### API Models (Updated at 2023.09.06):

**-- · BLS**: Based Broad Learning System, including ***BLSRegressor*** and ***BLSClassifier***. API ***fit*** and ***predict*** is available now. ***GridSearch*** will online soon. Paper Link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7987745/

**-- · Stacked-BLS**: A Stacked Model of Broad Learning System, with several residual learning block, including ***StackedBLSClassifier***. API ***fit*** and ***predict*** is available now. Paper Link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9308927/

**-- · Conv-BLS**: An ensemble model based on a simple convoloution module and a Broad Learning System module, which enhance the ability of feature extraction for original BLS. API of this model would be upload sonn.

**-- · MultiInput-BLS**: A novel idea of BLS. Upload soon.
